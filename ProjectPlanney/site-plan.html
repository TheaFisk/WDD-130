        Hey! My name is Thea, and this is my home page for my Project Planney website. On this page, I am going to include and introduction to who I am and a summary of the projects I will include.
        Each project will have a clickable Icon that leads to its subpage. On the home page, I will also Include a progress bar for each project.

      <h3>Remote Control Airplane</h3>
      <p>
        My RC plane project is a hands-on exploration of aerodynamics, electronics, and craftsmanship. I designed and built a remote-controlled aircraft from the ground up, incorporating lightweight materials, efficient propulsion systems, and precise control surfaces to optimize flight performance. Throughout the project, I experimented with different wing configurations, motor setups, and radio frequencies to enhance stability and maneuverability. This endeavor not only deepened my understanding of flight mechanics but also honed my problem-solving and engineering skills. Whether fine-tuning aerodynamics or troubleshooting electronic components, this project reflects my passion for aviation and innovation in model aircraft design.

      <h3>Painted Keyboards</h3>
      <p>
        My keyboard painting project is a creative fusion of art and technology, transforming ordinary keyboards into unique, hand-painted masterpieces. I carefully design and paint each keyboard with themes ranging from abstract patterns to detailed landscapes, ensuring both aesthetic appeal and durability. Using high-quality paints and sealants, I preserve the artwork while maintaining the keyboardâ€™s functionality. This project allows me to experiment with color theory, design principles, and different painting techniques, all while personalizing a daily-use item. Through this endeavor, I blend artistic expression with practical craftsmanship, making every keyboard a one-of-a-kind work of art.
